# Detection-and-Classification-of-Writing-Activity-in-Air

DataSet contains two subfolders DataSet_1 and DataSet_2:


DataSet_1 :
 
       This folder consist of 2 subfolders Train_Set and Test_set
           1) Train_Set again contains Two sub folders 1a). (X,Y)_Co-ordinates and 1b). Sensor 
	             1a). (X,Y)_Co-ordinates : 
		                  Contains 70 participants and each participants data is stored in separated folder id and that folder contains the(X,Y)Co-Ordinates calculated or extracted using raw sensor data in writing sequences
				  
		     1b). Sensor : 
		                  Contains 70 participants and each participants data is stored in separated folder id and that folder contains the  slected raw feature data taken from raw sensor data in writing sequences
